Exception should be more human readable so that one can understand it . Exception should have enough details where one understand the next action like retrial or data correction .  The customer or the support team will be able to monitor and take action on their own.  For example : In case of failure due to non availability of user , exception message should be “ User XYZ does not exist in CRM Z.Similarly , in case of unavailability of lead  , messaged should be on line  Lead doesnt exist in CRM or Unable to find lead id . Other details like email , crm name , task id should be well populated for each failure.

Image needs to fix for integration cards logo 2. Instead of multiple check api calls create one api so we will get data in one api call only so page will load faster.3. Based on integration already done or not , show connect or details button on admin integration cards.         If already integrated show DETAILS button         otherwise show CONNECT button.

(/mergedualaudio). so this api is basically creating the task by calling connector project which creates the task and returns the taskId so on getting the task Id at cueing side we basically merge the agent and customer audio as dual wav and update the audio url in task table for that taskId.\tExtension was hitting this API 2 times one on call start and one on call end .so the call  end was working fine and dual task was getting created because of hitting the API on call start.\t\t\tPhoneBurer has a dialsessionId which can have multiple calls.\t\twhen one call ends suppose its dialsessionId = 123 and callid= 456, then task is created for the callsid and audio url updated as dual wav.\t\tafter that suppose one more call started for the same dialsessionId so on start we usually hit the phoneburner api to get the toNumber and callid fo the dial session id and here the dial session id is same as the last call so phoneBurner dont have any records at the starting of the call and they give us the last call in response and their were no check on task creation … hence creating dual task for the last call. when their is same dial session id.\t\tPRs for above1.
