Good morning Daniel, I’m Hailey calling from Uplift Movers to help with your request for a quote. ?Yes and thanks for getting back to me. I’m helping my parents move from Saint Louis to Chicago in two weeks. What kind of information do you need for a quote, or what is the process? Happy to give you an overview.  we’ll verify availability for your move date, which I see you listed as March 10th from Saint Louis to Chicago.I just need some basic information about your items and the space. Then if you want to proceed based on that estimate, we would schedule a visit to the property for a survey of the items to get a final quote. OK I understand. How long does it take to schedule the visit? I’m a bit worried about running out of time given this is just two weeks away. Yes, it’s coming right up! I’ll make sure that scheduling page is included in the email with your estimate.  Great, okay. I’ll be sure to book the visit right away. So what else do we need in order to get the estimate? I just need a few details about the space and the items we’re moving. How big is your parent’s home in square footage? That’s a good question… I would say it’s about 2,500 square feet How many bedrooms? Three Yes there is a garage, two cars, yes there is a finished basement. No attic. Any special or large appliances like gym equipment or a freezer box, pool table, etc There is a pool table but that’s being moved separately I believe. Okay. Any other heavy or unusual items beyond furniture? I don’t think so. Alright Daniel, that is all I need to get an estimate ready for you. I’ll go put these details into the computer and have that email to you in the next 15 or 20 minutes. That sounds good, I really appreciate it. My pleasure to help. What questions do you have for me at this point I’m just curious, what is the price based on? Or how is the estimate calculated? Yes, it’s basically a formula based on weight of the items,  and the related labor costs which are hourly for packing and moving. Right, okay. Last question: Is the service insured? Or what if anything gets damaged or lost in the move? You’re very welcome. I’ll follow up with you soon. OK great. Take care. You too. Goodbye."

Exception should be more human readable so that one can understand it . Exception should have enough details where one understand the next action like retrial or data correction .  The customer or the support team will be able to monitor and take action on their own.  For example : In case of failure due to non availability of user , exception message should be “ User XYZ does not exist in CRM Z.Similarly , in case of unavailability of lead  , messaged should be on line  Lead doesnt exist in CRM or Unable to find lead id . Other details like email , crm name , task id should be well populated for each failure.

To resolve this we are adding a new key names scheduler url so that we can maintain the end point easily. It’s a generic fix that can reflect to all the upcoming integrations.

(/mergedualaudio). so this api is basically creating the task by calling connector project which creates the task and returns the taskId so on getting the task Id at cueing side we basically merge the agent and customer audio as dual wav and update the audio url in task table for that taskId.\tExtension was hitting this API 2 times one on call start and one on call end .so the call  end was working fine and dual task was getting created because of hitting the API on call start.\t\t\tPhoneBurer has a dialsessionId which can have multiple calls.\t\twhen one call ends suppose its dialsessionId = 123 and callid= 456, then task is created for the callsid and audio url updated as dual wav.\t\tafter that suppose one more call started for the same dialsessionId so on start we usually hit the phoneburner api to get the toNumber and callid fo the dial session id and here the dial session id is same as the last call so phoneBurner dont have any records at the starting of the call and they give us the last call in response and their were no check on task creation … hence creating dual task for the last call. when their is same dial session id.\t\tPRs for above1.

The \\\"X Factor\\\" of the title refers to the undefinable \\\"something\\\" that makes for star quality.[1] The prize is usually a recording contract, in addition to the publicity that appearance in the later stages of the show itself generates, not only for the winner but also for other highly ranked contestants. Unlike Idols, where the judges only critique the contestants performances, on The X Factor each judge \\\"mentors\\\" the finalists in a particular category, aiding them with song selection and styling, while also participating together in judging the contestants in the other categories. Not only Idols, but also new singing shows such as The Voice and All Together Now have become rivals and popular in recent years.\","
