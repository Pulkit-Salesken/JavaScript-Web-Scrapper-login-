Customers are more immune to pressure tricks and this hard tactic rarely works anymore. In 2021, it may even have the opposite effect and be damaging to the relationship. Lead your potential clients to the finishing line, but let them take the last step and cross it. They may raise their concerns right away, or take several days or weeks. In the case of the latter, stay patient and be willing to answer any questions in a neutral, non-pushy way. Often, the decision is not just about how things might work for them, but about their emotions too. Either way, they must feel comfortable and in control of the discussion and it must feel like their decision matters. Make sure you handle the last leg calmly and with ease, leading your prospective customers from uncertainty to certainty."

Prior to the pandemic, B2B selling was all about traditional, face-to-face interaction. The major components of B2B sales at that time were: On-site meet-up with prospects Regular factory tours to understand operations Physical meetings B2B sales process tends to be long due to the involvement of multiple decision-makers. Earlier, the B2B selling cycle used to be longer, with various physical touchpoints and of word-of-mouth referrals. B2B sales cycles continue to be long even now. However, the physical touchpoints have shifted to digital touchpoints. As a result, digital sales are dominating the B2B sector worldwide. For some businesses, this digital shift has been simpler since they already had a digital presence in the form of websites and social media. However, many companies had to start from square one and build their digital presence from scratch. To keep up with the biggest business-to-business sales trend, these organizations need to learn and implement various components of digital presence.\" } } } </script>"

Besides, Salesken sends out real-time cues while on the call itself. These conversation snippets are based on the unique call profile and positively influence your prospects' minds. It comes up with the best responses to your prospect's queries and assists your reps in customizing their sales pitch in real-time. And once the call is over, Salesken analyzes the call and gives out a pitch score. A pitch score is given by exploring all the signals that were raised and how the rep addressed them. Then, it compares it with the successful call and gives out a score on a scale of 1-100. It helps identify whether your rep performed well or not and the areas that need improvement for their next conversation."

For instance, a customer expressing dismay over poor customer service on two different occasions. Conversational AI’s ability to parse and understand human sentiment is perfect for inside sales where reps are often at a loss to interpret the customer's reactions or emotions in real time. Salesken, our conversational intelligence platform for sales reps, classifies emotional or sentiment signals in real-time. Our system has over 100,000 inferences allowing it to detect and decode various signals, from words to phrases to tonality to pitch, and then run it through multiple data models. Say your customer sounds low-spirited on the call. Salesken naturally scans for words that mirror these emotions. It can immediately recommend ways (sentences, phrases, words) in which your rep can be more empathetic to your customer during the conversation."
